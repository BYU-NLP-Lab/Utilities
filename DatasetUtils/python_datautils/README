A set of python tools to work with nlp data. The pipes.py 
replicates much of the java data import pipeline. 
pipes.py was written mostly to support the doc2vec.py script.

The doc2vec.py script allows you to train gensim 
models and use them to convert documents into 
continuous vectors using a pretty reputable, 
community-favored package (gensim). 
We went this way (pre-processing the data with python)
rather than finding native java models because the best 
java framework we could find, dl4j, hadn't yet tested 
their implementation of doc2vec.
