A number of byu nlp code projects depend on a corpus of possibly labeled data. 
This repository provides a java representation of data instances along with 
their associated labels, continuous metadata values, and annotation values. 
Also routines for IO from common document corpus formats. 

Historically, similar code was (re)created in each project. This project 
is an attempt to unify all such code, thereby decreasing code duplication 
and allowing projects to be more interoperable. However, because of 
this the objects in this code base need to support the union of the 
features supported by all other code bases and are therefore rather 
permissive in terms of the number of supported representations.
